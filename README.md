# 🗄️ KeyValueStore2 - A Simple In-Memory Key-Value Store. 

**KeyValueStore2** is a lightweight, **thread-safe, in-memory** key-value store with **persistent storage** and **command-line interface (CLI) support** that I had worked on sometime ago to brush up my C++. It features an **LRU cache** for fast lookups and stores data in JSON format.
I plan to transform this to a distributed key-value store by implementing networked communication (**gRPC?**), **sharding**, and consensus algorithms (**Raft** or **Paxos** ?) for consistency, making it suitable for large-scale distributed systems." 🚀
